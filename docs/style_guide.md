# Rooms

## Naming

Room names should follow the same guidelines as [book titles](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Capitalizing_Words_in_Titles).

## Descriptions

All descriptions should be indented by two spaces (not one tab).

## Line Lengths

No more than 80 characters per line (For both names and descriptions).  Try to 
keep them as close as possible without going over.

## Puncutation

All sentences ended should have two spaces after the puncutiation. (This is up 
for debate).
